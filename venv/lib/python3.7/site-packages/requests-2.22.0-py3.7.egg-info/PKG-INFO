        **Requests** is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.

        Behold, the power of Requests:
        
        ``` {.sourceCode .python}
        >>> import requests
        >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
        >>> r.status_code
        200
        >>> r.headers['content-type']
        'application/json; charset=utf8'
        >>> r.encoding
        'utf-8'
        >>> r.text
        u'{"type":"User"...'
        >>> r.json()
        {u'disk_usage': 368627, u'private_gists': 484, ...}
        ```
        
        See [the similar code, sans Requests](https://gist.github.com/973705).

        Requests allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* HTTP/1.1 requests,
        without the need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query
        strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and
        HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to
        [urllib3](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3).
        
        Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
        downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over 50,000,000
        downloads every month. You don't want to be left out!
